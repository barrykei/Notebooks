# Data Science Practice Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for practicing data science workflows with Cursor.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or use JupyterLab:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Notebooks

### `data_science_practice.ipynb`
A comprehensive notebook covering:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning basics

## Getting Started

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter
2. Run cells sequentially to see the data science workflow
3. Experiment with the code and modify it to practice
4. Use Cursor's AI features to:
   - Ask questions about the code
   - Generate new visualizations
   - Debug errors
   - Optimize code
   - Add new features

## Tips for Using Cursor with Jupyter Notebooks

- **Code completion**: Cursor's AI can help complete code cells
- **Explanations**: Ask Cursor to explain any part of the code
- **Debugging**: Paste error messages and get solutions
- **Refactoring**: Ask Cursor to improve or optimize your code
- **Documentation**: Generate markdown cells with explanations
- **New features**: Ask Cursor to add new analysis or visualizations

## Next Steps

- Try loading real datasets from Kaggle or other sources
- Experiment with different machine learning models
- Create custom visualizations
- Add more advanced analysis techniques
- Practice feature engineering
- Try time series analysis or NLP tasks
